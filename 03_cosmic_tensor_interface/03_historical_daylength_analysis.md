# Historical Analysis of Day Length and Rotation Period

---

## Observational Facts

- In ancient times (e.g., dinosaur era), a day was shorter than now.
- ⇒ Earth's rotation has been **slowing down** over time.

---

## Limitations of Existing Theories

- Tidal friction and other external causes can't fully explain **inconsistent variations**.
- Evidence exists for temporary acceleration periods, which contradict simple models.

---

## Interpretation from E-TIM

- Energium core output is not constant → leads to alternating acceleration/deceleration phases.
- Changes in cosmic pressure (due to galactic environmental shifts) alter tensor deformation magnitude.

---

## Conclusion

- Rotation period variations can be explained by **tensor structural changes and energy source shifts**.
- Internal structural evolution, not just tides, plays a significant role.
