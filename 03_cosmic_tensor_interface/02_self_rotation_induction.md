# Diffusion Force → Self-Rotation → Structural Fixation Flow

---

## Why Does Earth Rotate?

- Biased cosmic pressure causes "space deformation" in proto-planets.
- This deformation propagates as "rotational torque" into internal structures.
- As a result, self-rotation is induced and spiral magnetic fields are generated.

## Mutual Induction Between Rotation and Magnetic Structure

- Rotation gives directional alignment to spiral tensors.
- Tensor circulation contributes to preservation and acceleration of rotational momentum.

---

## Transition to Current Structure

- Initial: External torque → rotation generation.
- Now: **Autonomous rotation** maintained by tensor circulation.
- Rotation is now a self-sustaining structure needing no external energy.

## Conclusion

- Earth's rotation is a byproduct of "torsional deformation induced by unidirectional cosmic pressure."
- Stabilized through synergy with tensor structures.
