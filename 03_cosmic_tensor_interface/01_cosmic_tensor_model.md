# Cosmic Pressure and Diffusive Tensor Model

---

## What is Cosmic Pressure?

- Cosmic space contains directional "pressure structures."
- Due to non-uniformity in interstellar space, minute **pressure gradients** arise.
- These pressures act on local space structures as "sphericalizing tensors."

---

## Effect During Earth's Formation

- Cosmic tensor pressures guided the proto-Earth core toward a **spherical shape**.
- Internal pressure formed the crust and expelled tensor structures (linked to geomagnetism).

---

## Diffusion Origin and Directionality

- Pressure sources are likely from "external galaxies" or "residual energy from the galactic center."
- Earth's rotation and tensor orientation are determined by these cosmic **pressure vectors**.

---

## Conclusion

- All Earth structures were born under **tensor constraints from space**.
- The formation of a sphere within diffusion is the foundational structure of E-TIM.
