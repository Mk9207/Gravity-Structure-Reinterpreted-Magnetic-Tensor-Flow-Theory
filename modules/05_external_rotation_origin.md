# 05. External Rotation Origin

This module explains the planetary rotation as a result of cosmic pressure exerted from outside the planetary system.

## Structure
- Rotation is not self-generated, but a result of cosmic tensor compression
- The planet rotates horizontally due to lateral pressure from cosmic expansion
- Angular momentum conserved through spatial tension

## Implication
- Justifies rotation across multiple celestial bodies with consistent axis direction
