# 02. Comparison with Classical Theories

This table highlights how this model differs from Newtonian and Einsteinian gravity.

| Aspect | Newton | Einstein | Tensor Spiral Theory |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Gravity Source | Mass attraction | Spacetime curvature | Magnetic-electronic tensor interaction |
| Shape Cause | Uniform pull | Geodesics in curvature | Spherical constraint by external pressure |
| Rotation | Inertial or assumed | Frame dragging | External cosmic pressure |
| Magnetic Role | None | Minimal | Central to flow and gravity output |

---

Key insight: Gravity here is **not caused by mass**, but emerges from **magnetic-electronic flow under spatial constraint**.
