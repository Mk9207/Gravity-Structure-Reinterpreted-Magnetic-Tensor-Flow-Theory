# 06. Spherical Constraint

This module addresses why planetary bodies maintain a spherical shape despite rotation.

## Structure
- Outer cosmic pressure prevents elongation of the body
- Internal flow is constrained vertically to maintain spherical volume
- Deformation into ellipsoids resisted by equalized internal-external forces

## Implication
- Supports existence of spiral internal flow rather than equatorial rotation
