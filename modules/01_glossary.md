# 01. Glossary: Core Terminology

This document explains key terms essential for understanding the theory.

---

### PTS (Polar-Tensor Spiral)
An internal fluid dynamics model based on spiral motion from pole to pole within planetary bodies.

### Energium
A hypothetical element located in the planetary core that exhibits strong magnetic reactivity to electron polarity. Functions as a reactive driver of the internal flow.

### Tensor Flow
A structured flow of internal matter influenced by both the magnetic core and external cosmic pressure. It moves in a polar spiral configuration.

### Magnetic Flux Line
Invisible lines representing the direction and strength of a planetâ€™s magnetic field, originating from poles and looping back.

### Gravitational Gradient
The variation in gravitational force from poles to equator due to interaction between centrifugal forces and tensor flow dynamics.
