# 08. Gravity Distribution Map

This module maps the difference in gravity across planetary latitudes.

## Structure
- Gravity strongest at poles due to both magnetic and tensor output
- Gravity weaker at equator due to centrifugal force
- Magnetic return zone (south pole) exhibits stabilized but weaker gravity

## Implication
- Matches observed measurements of gravity variation
- Suggests that tensor flow determines effective gravity direction
