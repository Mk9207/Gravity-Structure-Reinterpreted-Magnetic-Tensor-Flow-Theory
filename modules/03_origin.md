# 03. Why Earth Spins and Stays Spherical

### The Problem
Why does Earth rotate and still maintain a near-perfect spherical shape?

---

### Core Explanation

- Earth rotates due to **external cosmic expansion pressure**, not internal angular momentum.
- External pressure **forces** it into a **spherical shape**, disallowing elongation.
- To reconcile this, Earth develops **internal spiral tensor flows** to relieve inner tension.

### Visualization

Imagine a bubble in flowing water:
- The flow causes rotation
- The pressure keeps it round
- Inner currents develop to balance

Same applies to Earth.

### Result
- Rotation = from outside
- Shape = enforced from outside
- Internal flow = response to internal pressure buildup
