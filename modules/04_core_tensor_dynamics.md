# 04. Core Tensor Dynamics

This module describes the spiral flow of internal planetary fluid, structured along the polar axis.

## Structure
- Flow begins from the north pole and spirals inward along the core
- Central repulsion redistributes energy outward toward the equator
- Flow returns to the south pole via a spiral stream

## Implication
- Explains why gravity is strongest at poles
- Polar ejection and equatorial return flow sustain internal circulation
