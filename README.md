# Planetary Tensor Core Dynamics

> A Unified Theory of Planetary Gravity Based on Spiral Internal Tensor Flow and External Cosmic Constraints

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository reconstructs planetary gravity not as mass-based attraction, but as the **result of spiral internal tensor flows and rotational pressure induced by cosmic expansion**.

The theory is composed of the following elements:

- Rotation: Horizontal rotation initiated by external cosmic expansion pressure
- Spherical Constraint: Planetary bodies are forced to retain a spherical shape due to cosmic pressure
- Internal Tensor: Spiral flow from poles to poles generated by conflict between rotational force and spherical confinement
- Internal Core: A central reactor (e.g., Energium) that sustains the flow energy
- Magnetic Lines: Output and return flux lines formed at poles synchronized with internal flow
- Gravity: Emerges as the combined effect of internal repulsion and magnetic coupling

This theory rejects the conventional "mass-based gravity" model and interprets gravity as arising from tensor structures generated by differential rotation, density contrasts, and conductivity gradients within the Earth's interior.  
These tensors propagate pressure asymmetrically from the poles toward the equator, forming the basis of what is observed as gravity.

Importantly, this tensor structure **only deforms space as a background field and does not constitute a "force" by itself**.  
When **electrons or matter with a non-zero electron density** exist within this deformed spatial structure, the tensor field interacts resonantly with the electronic structure of the matter, thereby **producing the observable effect of gravity as an attractive force**.

Therefore, it is crucial to note that **in a space devoid of electrons or any charge structure, the tensor field may exist, but the gravitational effect (i.e., the experience of being pulled) will not emerge**.  
This stems from the fundamental definition of gravity in this theory as **"spatial deformation Ã— electronic response"**.
