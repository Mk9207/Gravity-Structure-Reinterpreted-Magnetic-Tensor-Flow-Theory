# Planetary Tensor Core Dynamics

> A Unified Theory of Planetary Gravity Based on Spiral Internal Tensor Flow and External Cosmic Constraints

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository reconstructs planetary gravity not as mass-based attraction, but as the **result of spiral internal tensor flows and rotational pressure induced by cosmic expansion**.

The theory is composed of the following elements:

- Rotation: Horizontal rotation initiated by external cosmic expansion pressure
- Spherical Constraint: Planetary bodies are forced to retain a spherical shape due to cosmic pressure
- Internal Tensor: Spiral flow from poles to poles generated by conflict between rotational force and spherical confinement
- Internal Core: A central reactor (e.g., Energium) that sustains the flow energy
- Magnetic Lines: Output and return flux lines formed at poles synchronized with internal flow
- Gravity: Emerges as the combined effect of internal repulsion and magnetic coupling
