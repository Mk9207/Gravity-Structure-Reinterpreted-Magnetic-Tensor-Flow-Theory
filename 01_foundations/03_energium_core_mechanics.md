# The Energium Core: Functionality and Structural Role

## Definition and Structure

- Deep within Earth exists a highly reactive magnetic core (hypothetical: Energium)
- This core acts as both the **reaction point and regenerative driver** of tensor flows

## Functional Mechanism

- Spiral tensors from the poles converge on the central core
- The core emits repulsive magnetic responses, redistributing the energy
- Creates a closed circulation loop → perpetual spiral motion

## Basis for Perpetuity

- As long as the Energium core exists, the tensor loop remains sustained and accelerated
- Loss of the core would lead to decay → collapse of gravity and magnetic field

## Model Illustration (Omitted)

- Spiral structure encircles the core → ensures constant output position
- Core re-emits energy in sync with Earth’s rotation → zero-loss loop

## Comparison to Other Theories

- Traditional: Core = heat source or convection center (insufficient to explain gravity/magnetic field)
- Here: magnetic output + inductive response → **gravity, magnetism, and circulation co-emerge**
