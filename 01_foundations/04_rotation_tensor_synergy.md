# Co-Evolution Structure of Earth's Rotation and Internal Tensor (Fully Integrated with Supplement)

---

## ðŸ”· Origin: How Did Rotation Arise?

- At the time of Earth's formation, **cosmic tensor (expansion pressure)** forced a spherical structure and created spatial strain in all directions.  
- This **anisotropic strain (especially along the polar axis)** induced initial rotational torque.  
- Once initiated, rotation persists due to **inertial continuity â†’ structural fixation**.

---

## ðŸ”· Relationship with Internal Tensor

- The direction of Earth's rotation determines the **winding direction of the internal spiral tensor**  
ã€€(Tensors always circulate in synchronization with rotation)

- Tensor circulation provides a **rotation-preserving effect**  
ã€€(Internal energy flows supplement rotational momentum)

- Rotation and tensor form a **bidirectional feedback structure**, reinforcing each other.

## ðŸ”· Current Structure: Self-Sustaining Rotation Without External Forces

- Although Earth's initial rotation was caused by cosmic pressure tensors, it is now **structurally capable of autonomous rotation**.

- Reasons:
  - The spiral tensor continuously circulates internally, forming rotational momentum.
  - The energium core or outer shell acts as the **output and repulsion point** of the circulation, providing continuous energy.

- Result:
  - Even if cosmic pressure disappears, **Earth can continue to rotate**.
  - This is a result of self-sustaining dynamics fixed by the strain of spherical structure.

## ðŸ”· Consistency with Ancient Periods

- Ancient Earth (formation to early phase):  
ã€€Cosmic tensor + undeveloped internal tensor â†’ **acceleration phase**

- Present:  
ã€€Energium core and outer shell structure complete â†’ **stabilization phase with slight deceleration**

- Contributing Factors:
  - Variability in cosmic expansion pressure
  - Saturation of energium response
  - Crustal distribution and convective interference

## ðŸ”· Supplement: Spiral Magnetic Line Structure and Gravity Distribution

- Internal tensors are **spirally emitted toward the poles**.
- Emitted magnetic lines **trace along the surface in a spiral pattern**, returning to the opposite pole.

- The equator is the point **farthest from both the output and return poles**, where tensor influence is weakest.

- Paradoxically, if tensor strength were greater,  
ã€€**the equator could exhibit maximum gravity** due to overlapping emission and absorption points.

### ðŸ”š Conclusion

- Rotation originated from cosmic tensor induction and has since formed a **perfectly synchronized structure with internal tensors**.
- Present rotation is a **self-circulating structure independent of external factors**.
- This forms the foundation for a new model of gravity and Earth geophysics incorporating tensor and magnetic structures.
