# The Necessity of Vertical Spiral Tensor Structure Inside Earth

## Problem Statement

- A rotating sphere (like Earth) should naturally have horizontal tensor flows
- However, measurements and models indicate persistent vertical spiral flows

## External Cause: Spherical Formation by Cosmic Pressure

- Cosmic tensor = Diffusive pressure â†’ Enforces Earth's spherical shape
- Horizontal expansion is suppressed, leaving only poles as pressure release paths
- Result: Internal energy flows become spiral flows toward the poles

## Internal Cause: Optimal Tensor Path

- In a spherical system, the least-resistant, most stable flow path is vertical spiral
- At the equator: interference from centrifugal and diffusion forces prevents circulation
- Spiral arises as a consequence of vertical flow + magnetic field direction

## Conclusion

- The vertical spiral tensor is a **necessary structure** for maintaining spherical shape
- Independent from rotation, it forms the internal circulation model
