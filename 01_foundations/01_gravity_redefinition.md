# Redefinition of Gravity: Toward the Electron-Magnetic Coupling Model

## Background: Limitations of Conventional Gravity Theories

- Newton: Gravity as an attractive force between masses (no essential definition)
- Einstein: Gravity as a curvature of space (limited observability)
- Quantum Gravity Theories: Unestablished (no graviton, lack of unification)
- Cannot explain surface gravity differences (e.g., between poles and equator)

## Definition in E-TIM Theory

- Gravity = Inductive tensor coupling between electronic structure and Earth's magnetic field
- Gravitational response of matter is determined not by mass, but by electron density, polarity, and structural responsiveness

## Structural Model

- Earth: a spiral magnetic field generator (geomagnetic tensor)
- This field projects vectorial tensor pressure across space
- Each material exhibits different gravitational responses based on its structure (electron cloud distribution, polarity, and density)

| Structure | Electronic Properties | Gravity Response |
|----------|------------------------|------------------|
| Metal | High electron density, many free electrons | Strong inductive coupling â†’ high gravity |
| Insulator | Strong electron binding, polar | Weak coupling but present (may appear heavier per volume) |
| Gas | Sparse electron density, low polarity | Minimal response, low gravity |
| Ozone | Rises due to internal atmospheric pressure displacement (not anti-gravity) |

## Applied Significance and Reinforcement

- By redefining gravity as an electronic response, material differences are directly reflected in gravitational behavior
- Provides a theoretical foundation for gravity control and material-based engineering
