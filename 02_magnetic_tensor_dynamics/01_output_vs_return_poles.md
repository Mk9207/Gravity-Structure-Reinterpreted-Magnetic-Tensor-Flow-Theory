# Differences in Gravity and Magnetic Responses at Output and Return Poles

---

## Problem Statement

Although both the North and South Poles are magnetic poles, their gravity responses differ.

Phenomena have been reported where one pole functions more like an output point, while the other acts more like a return point, creating localized gravity differences.

## Theoretical Reconstruction

The Earth is a spiral-shaped magnetic tensor emitter.

One of the poles (either North or South) functions as the "output point" (magnetic field emission), while the other serves as the "return point" (magnetic field absorption).

This asymmetry causes local differences in both gravitational and magnetic responses.

## Conclusion

Although the poles appear symmetrical, their magnetic and gravitational behaviors are asymmetrical.

At the output point, the electronic structures of materials are more easily repelled; at the return point, they are more easily attracted.

Even at the same altitude and latitude, gravity differences can arise based on directional magnetic dynamics.
