# Gravitational Response Differences by Electron Structure: Insulators vs Conductors

---

## Principle

Gravity is defined as the interaction between electrons and Earth's magnetic field.

The electronic density, bond structure, and polarity of each material determine its gravitational response.

## Insulators vs Conductors

| Category       | Conductors               | Insulators               |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Electron Density | High                     | Medium to Low             |
| Free Electrons  | Many                     | Few                       |
| Polarity        | Low (loose bonds)        | High (strong bonds)       |
| Gravity Response| Strong induction response | Some structures respond strongly due to high density and polarity |

## Special Case

Some insulators, due to their high-density and strong polarity, appear heavier than conductors.

This necessitates redefining gravity not by mass but by electronic structural responsiveness.
