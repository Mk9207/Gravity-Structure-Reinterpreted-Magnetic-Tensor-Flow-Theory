# Spatial Distribution of Magnetic Field Lines and Their Contribution to Gravity Gradients

---

## Model Proposition

The traditional model that assumes isotropic expansion of magnetic fields around a spherical Earth is unrealistic.

Instead, Earth's internal tensors interact with spiral magnetic field emissions at the poles, forming return circulations.

## Distribution Structure

Spiral magnetic field lines are denser near the poles and sparse around the equator.

Magnetic field gradients vary with latitude, thereby affecting gravitational gradients.

---

## Response Outcome

At higher latitudes, electronic structures are strongly induced, resulting in heightened gravitational response.

Near the equator, the weakening magnetic field reduces gravitational responsiveness.

This trend aligns with observed data (gravity at poles > gravity at equator).
