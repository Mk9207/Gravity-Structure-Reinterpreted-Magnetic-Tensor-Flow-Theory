# Verification of Simulated Gravity Sphere Against Measured Differences

---

## Verification Issue

Gravity simulations using virtual models show differences between equator and poles.

Real-world measurements reflect similar differences (e.g., gravitational acceleration).

---

## Consistency Analysis

At the poles, concentrated magnetic lines enhance electron induction.

At the equator, sparse magnetic lines lead to weaker induction.

Even in virtual sphere models, latitudinal differences in electronic response naturally produce gravity differences.

---

## Conclusion

Conventional theories (like Newtonian gravity) fail to fully explain such differences.

E-TIM structurally accounts for them and uses simulation as a tool to support theoretical validity.
