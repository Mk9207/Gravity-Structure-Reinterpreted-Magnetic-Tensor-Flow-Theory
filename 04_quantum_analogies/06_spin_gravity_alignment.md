# Electron Spin Orientation and Gravity Resonance

## Hypothesis

- Electron spin aligning or opposing geomagnetic tensor â†’ affects gravity response strength
- Material with aligned spins may appear heavier/lighter

## Proposed Mechanism

- Compare gravity response in isotopes or spin-polarized materials
- Resonance (alignment) = stronger induction, Anti-phase = weaker induction

## Status

- Still a **quantum theoretical hypothesis**, but structurally aligns with E-TIM's vector gravity model
- Applicable to spin-controllable materials (e.g., quantum devices)
