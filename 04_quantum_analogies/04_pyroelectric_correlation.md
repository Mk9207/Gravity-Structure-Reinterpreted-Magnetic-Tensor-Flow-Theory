# Pyroelectric Effect and Gravity Response

## Principle

- Pyroelectricity: temperature change induces charge separation in crystals
- External energy modifies **electronic structure and electric field generation**

## Gravity Connection

- Earth's magnetic tensor causes **charge separation and reactive pressure** in crystal structures
- Pyroelectric response ≒ Inductive gravity response

## Conclusion

- Pyroelectric effect bridges **heat × structure × electron × magnetism = gravity variation**
- Some crystals may show gravity fluctuation with environmental changes
