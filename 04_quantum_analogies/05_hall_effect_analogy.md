# Hall Effect and Tensor Gravity Analogy

## Principle

- Hall effect: electrons deflected by magnetic field causing voltage across conductor
- Inverse Hall: induced magnetic field by applying electric voltage

## Gravity Analogy

| Element       | Hall Effect                          | Gravity (E-TIM)                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Cause         | Magnetic field × Electron flow       | Earth's magnetic field × Electron structure |
| Response      | Transverse voltage (deflection)      | Downward pressure (induction)            |
| Structure     | Vector field × Electrons             | Tensor field × Electron clouds           |

## Conclusion

- Gravity as "directional vector field → electron induction" shows **strong mathematical similarity** to Hall effect
- Material-dependent responses appear consistently in both
