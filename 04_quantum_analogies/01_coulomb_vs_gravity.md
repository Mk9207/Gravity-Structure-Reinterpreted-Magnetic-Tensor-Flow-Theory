# Coulomb Force vs Gravity (E-TIM)

## Definition Comparison

| Item         | Coulomb Force                      | Gravity (E-TIM)                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Medium       | Electric charge × Electric field   | Electronic structure × Geomagnetic tensor |
| Interaction  | Attraction/repulsion via static field | Inductive coupling with directional force |
| Distance     | Inverse square law                 | Geomagnetic gradient + induction strength |
| Target       | Point charge                       | Distributed electron cloud               |

## Structural Homology

- Both can be reformulated as force from "medium × spatial vector field"
- Coulomb = direct, E-TIM = mediated (secondary vector pressure)
- Despite difference between point vs distributed charge, structural similarity is high

## Reinforcement

- Gravity should be understood not as "invisible force" but as **vector gradient of inductive response**, enabling similar mathematical treatment as Coulomb force.
