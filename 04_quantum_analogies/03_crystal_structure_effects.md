# Crystal Structure and Gravity Response

## Principle

- Even with same chemical composition, **crystal structures (single/poly/amorphous)** affect electronic resonance
- Higher electron density and directional resonance â†’ stronger gravity induction response

## Experimental Candidates

- Compare gravity between single crystal, polycrystalline, and amorphous forms of same material
- Detect gravity as a result of "electronic resonance structure"

## Conclusion

- Mass may be constant, but apparent "weight difference" can be structurally explained in E-TIM
- Especially **single-crystal + strong polarity** = maximum induction
