# Predictive Applications of Future Geomagnetic & Gravity Anomalies

## Application Challenge

- Gravity/magnetic anomalies affect navigation, weather, climate, ecosystems
- Existing models insufficient → new structural theory needed

## E-TIM Application Models

- Based on "spiral tensor structure" of geomagnetism:
  - Latitude-specific gravity gradient prediction
  - Magnetic storm forecasting
  - Analysis of geomagnetic reversal precursors

## Targeted Application Domains

| Domain | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Aerospace | Gravity anomaly–adjusted routes, magneto-navigation |
| Seismology | Earthquake prediction using magnetic fluctuations |
| Meteorology | Atmospheric pattern tracking via gravity-magnetic coupling |
| Agriculture/Ecology | Predicting biological/environmental shifts from gravity changes |

## Conclusion

- Electron × magnetic field interaction model enables early detection of shifts
- Viewing gravity as a “reaction” boosts future prediction accuracy significantly
