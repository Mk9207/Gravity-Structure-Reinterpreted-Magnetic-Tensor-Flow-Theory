# Structural Collapse Scenario from Energium Loss

## Hypothesis

- Energium core is the driving source of Earth’s tensor flow and gravity
- This models the impact of degradation/loss of this core

## Predicted Phase-wise Impacts

| Phase | Phenomenon | Result |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Initial | Tensor strength decreases | Local gravity decline, magnetic field disturbance |
| Mid | Spiral circulation breakdown | Unstable rotation, seismic activity rises |
| Final | Gravitational system collapse | Orbital drift, atmospheric loss, planetary instability |

## Supporting Observations

- Magnetic pole reversals and geomagnetic extinction observed align as early-stage symptoms
- Existence of tensor structures supports gravity–magnetism stability

## Conclusion

- Conventional gravity theories can't explain these interlinked phenomena
- E-TIM provides coherent explanation via tensor–magnetism–structural circulation model
