# Polar vs Equator Gravity Data Comparison

## Measured Data

- Equator: Gravity acceleration ≈ 9.780 m/s²
- Poles: Gravity acceleration ≈ 9.832 m/s²
- Difference ≈ 0.052 m/s² (≈ 0.5%)

## Explanation in Conventional Theories (Incomplete)

- Attenuation due to centrifugal force (near the equator)
- Equatorial bulge due to rotation increases distance from mass center

▶ However, they cannot explain "inductive structural response by latitude"
▶ Also cannot address material-specific differences (e.g., conductor vs insulator)

## Reinterpretation in E-TIM

- Spiral structure of geomagnetic tensor concentrates around poles
- Magnetic tensor weakens near the equator → lower gravitational response
- This is explained as latitude-dependent “electron induction coupling reaction”

## Conclusion

- Measured values align with E-TIM's magnetic field–based gravity model
- Gravity should be explained as “resonance between magnetic tensors and electronic structures” rather than mere rotation
